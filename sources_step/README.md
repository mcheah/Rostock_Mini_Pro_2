.step files are generated by importing each .scad manually into FreeCAD and exporting to .step.  Use `export_scad.py \<stepFileName\>` to automate this process.  Note that the appropriate paths need to be setup to refer to theFreeCAD python environment.  use export_scad_macos.zsh` to see how this is
managed.

Some notes on OpenSCAD compatibility with FreeCAD:
- FreeCAD does not parse 2d shapes correctly when importing.  This means that linear_extrude operations should be replaced with the 3d equivalent operations when possible
    - cylinder instead of circle
    - cube instead of square
    - prism instead of polygon
- DXF files need to be directly imported to FreeCAD manually and extruded
- FreeCAD seems to have trouble with complex unions and difference operations.  When possible it may be necessary to re-partition operations or re-order equivalent fuse operations to avoid crashes when exporting
- the `export_scad.py` script currently attempts to only export the top level geometries, which results in components being fused as a single part.  To preserve these individual components the `\<PreserveNodes\>` parameter can be used to keep shapes by name.  This is a largely manual process.
